  <p>This project aims to compare the speed of using Rust in conjunction with Node.js and Node.js with TypeScript, and determine whether it's worth using Rust for certain tasks. The primary objective of this repository is to compare the performance of these technologies by receiving arrays of strings and returning an object for each element in the array with the letters separated.</h3>

  <p>Ultimately, the goal of this project is to provide developers with a clear understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of using Rust compared to Node.js and TypeScript, and to help them make informed decisions when choosing the appropriate technology for their projects.</h3>
